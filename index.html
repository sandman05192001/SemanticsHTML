                        When I was my younger days, I was a lively and curious child, always seeking new adventures. 
                        I loved trying new things and playing soccer with the neighborhood boys was a daily thrill, even if it led to a swollen foot once in a while.
                        During my teenage years, I became quieter, finding comfort in reading non-fiction books and teaching myself various skills. 
                        I was more focused on self-improvement than the wild escapades of my younger days.As I entered adulthood, I became more mindful and aware. 
                        Life's lessons transformed me into a deliberate and purposeful individual. I learned to balance ambition with introspection, creating a more intentional and fulfilling life.
                        From a spirited child to a contemplative adult, my journey was marked by curiosity, resilience, and a commitment to personal growth. Each experience, whether joyful or challenging, shaped me into the person I am today, and my story continues to unfold with each passing moment.

                            Idk this person.Jokes! I love this girl even though I 
                            considered our friendship a bad maintenance friend since we're 
                            both busy with work and studies. But when we meet up, the 
                            connection is still the same.</p>
