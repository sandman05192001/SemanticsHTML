        <p>
            I used to lie on the floor for hours after
            school with the phone cradled between
            my shoulder and my ear, a plate of cold
            rice to my left, my school books to my right.
            Twirling the cord between my fingers
            I spoke to friends who recognized the
            language of our realm. Throats and lungs
            swollen, we talked into the heart of the night,
            toying with the idea of hair dye and suicide,
            about the boys who didnâ€™t love us, 
            who we loved too much, the pang
            of the nights. Each sentence was
            new territory, like a door someone was
            rushing into, the glass shattering
            with delirium, with knowledge and fear.
            My Mother never complained about the phone bill,
            what it cost for her daughter to disappear
            behind a door, watching the cord
            stretching its muscle away from her.
